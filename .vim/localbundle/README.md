# TagHighlight

TagHighlight is a plugin that highlights names of classes, variables, types etc in source code in Vim.

The source is managed in Mercurial and is available on [bitbucket][Bitbucket].

I used to use Git to manage the source code for TagHighlight, but I had a **lot** of problems with it.  In particular, I kept finding commits going missing as branches were being created even when the development should have been linear!  I spent a huge amount of time trying to fix this and finally gave up and moved the code to Mercurial.  My original intention was to maintain a git mirror and I did this for a while, but github won't let me push the latest changes as it thinks they conflict with previous changes.  I've spent two hours trying to get github to play ball and I'm now giving up.  Sorry to anyone who wanted to use the git mirror.
